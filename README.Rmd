**FingermatchR** provides fingerprint matching tools based on NIST's MINDTCT and BOZORTH3 algorithms, as released in [NIST's Biometrics Image Software suite (NBIS)](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/nist-biometric-image-software-nbis).

## Installation

Make sure you have NBIS installed with binaries available in PATH. Check in particular that you have the `mindtct` and `bozorth3` executables installed and available:
```bash
$ mindtct
  Usage : mindtct [-b] [-m1] <finger_img_in> <oroot>
        -b  = contrast boost image
        -m1 = output "*.xyt" according to ANSI INCITS 378-2004
        ...
$ bozorth3
  Usage:
   To compute match scores for fingerprint pairs:
        bozorth3 [options] probefile.xyt galleryfile.xyt [probefile galleryfile ...]
        ...

```

You can install the development version of **fingermatchR** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forensic-science/fingermatchR")
```

## Examples

```{r}
library(fingermatchR)
```

Define location of NBIS executables:

```{r}
# This is required if NBIS executables are not available in PATH.
options(NBIS_bin = "/home/olivier/Desktop/Research/forensic-science/NBIS/src/bin")
```

Detect minutiae using mindtct:

```{r}
imgfiles = list.files("data-raw", pattern = "*.png", full.names = TRUE)
out = mindtct(imgfiles, outputdir="data-raw")
```
